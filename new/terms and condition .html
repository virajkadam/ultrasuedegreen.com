members are fully aware of these standards and principles.

<h5 class="mt-3" class="mt-3">CONFLICT OF INTEREST</h5>

All staff members are expected not to engage in any activity which can cause conflict between
their interests and the company’s interests, such as

members are forbidden from holding any personal interest in any organisation supplying goods

<h5 class="mt-3" class="mt-3">CONFIDENTIALITY</h5>

All staff members are required not to divulge any secrets/information of the company to an
outsider even after leaving the service of the company unless it is so required by a court of law.
During service in the Company, they should not disseminate any information relating to business
secrets of the company without the consent of management.

<h5 class="mt-3" class="mt-3">KICKBACKS</h5>

All staff members are strictly forbidden not to accept any favours, gifts or kickbacks from any
organization dealing with the company. In case such a favour is considered, in the interest of the
company, the same should be disclosed clearly to the management.

<h5 class="mt-3">PROPER ACCOUNTS KEEPING</h5>

All funds, receipts, and disbursements should be properly recorded in the accounts books of the
company. No false or fictitious entries should be made or misleading statements about the
company or its operations should be issued. All agreements with agents, dealers, and
consultants should be made in writing and supported with the required evidence.
RELATIONSHIP WITH GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS SUPPLIERS, AGENTS ETC.
The dealings of the company with Government officials, suppliers, buyers, agents and
consultants of the company should always be such that the integrity of the company and
reputation is not damaged. Members having queries in connection with how to deal with these
requirements should consult the management.

<h5 class="mt-3">HEALTH AND SAFETY</h5>

Every staff member is required to take care of his health and safety and those working with him.
The management is responsible for keeping its staff members insured as per government rules
and regulations.

<h5 class="mt-3">ALCOHOL, DRUGS</h5>

All types of gambling and betting at the companies are strictly forbidden. Also, taking any
alcohol or drugs inside the workplace is not allowed and any member of the staff, not abiding by
these prohibitions will attract disciplinary as well as penal action under the law.
COORDINATION AMONG STAFF MEMBERS TO MAINTAIN DISCIPLINE
All staff members will work in close coordination with their co-workers, superiors, and
colleagues. Every member will cooperate with other members so that the company’s work is
carried out effectively and efficiently. All cases of non-cooperation among staff members should
be reported to the management for necessary and suitable action. Strict disciplinary action will
be taken against those staff members who violate the rules and regulations of the company.

<h5 class="mt-3">WORKPLACE HARASSMENT</h5>

All members of the staff will provide an environment that is free from harassment and in which
all employees are equally respected. Workplace harassment means any action that creates an
intimidating, hostile or offensive environment which may include sexual harassment and
disparaging remarks based on gender, religion, race or ethnicity.

<h5 class="mt-3">Forced labor</h5>

We do not accept forced labour, work unwillingly performed or unpaid work in any form. This
includes agreements made under forced conditions and illegal workforces. Furthermore, we do
not accept methods that restrict the free movement of employees, and no person may be kept
at work for any time against that person’s will.

<h5 class="mt-3">Child labor</h5>

The UN’s Convention on the Rights of the Child, the International Labor Organization’s
Convention concerning the Minimum Age for Admission to Employment and the Convention
concerning the Prohibition and Immediate Action for the Elimination of the Worst Forms of Child
Labor, serve as guidelines for all business conducted in our name. No person below the age of
having completed compulsory schooling or below the age of 15 years may be employed. If it is
found that a child is working at one of our suppliers, we request action to be taken to remedy the
problem, provided that such action does not lead to a worsening of the child’s social situation.
Should shortcomings still exist after the supplier has been given reasonable time and
opportunity to remedy such shortcomings, the supplier shall be replaced.

<h5 class="mt-3">Working environment</h5>

We seek constant improvement in health and safety in the workplace and work to provide our
employees with a safe working environment. We will as a minimum strictly observe national
laws and/or collective bargaining agreements. Suppliers shall as a minimum observe applicable
laws and regulations concerning the working environment and working conditions. We also
demand that our suppliers prioritize the health and safety of their employees and expect that
suitable provision is made for safety, that equipment and buildings are safe, and that the use of
hazardous materials is reduced to a minimum. Waste has to be minimized and if any, dealt with
safely.

<h5 class="mt-3">Pay and work</h5>

The terms and conditions of employment, including financial compensation and working hours,
that are offered to our employees shall at least meet the minimum requirements of national
legislation if any, or shall be in line with relevant standards in the locations where we conduct
business. Suppliers shall apply working hours and pay wages and overtime compensation at
least following national laws and agreements, or following standard practice in local industry.

<h5 class="mt-3">Equal opportunity</h5>

We advocate change and development and take the view that this is not possible to achieve in a
workplace that does not offer equal opportunity. Against that background, we strive for an
inclusive environment in which employees are offered equal opportunity for development,
training, compensation and terms and conditions of employment, irrespective of gender, age,
ethnic or national background, religion, sexual disposition, disability, or other distinguishing
characteristics. In cases where compensation gaps exist, we shall make active efforts to even
these out. We also strive for an equal balance in recruitment.

<h5 class="mt-3">Discrimination</h5>

Our corporate culture is non‐discriminatory and based on responsibility and respect. We are
convinced that good results, job satisfaction, commitment and cooperation are achieved through
diversity, and all employees are offered equal development opportunities, irrespective of gender,
age, ethnic or national background, religion, sexual orientation, disability, or other distinguishing
characteristics. We do not allow any discrimination or harassment in any form.

</h5 class="mt-3 mb-4">Environmental policy</h5>

We work proactively to continually reduce our direct and indirect environmental impact. Eco
cycle thinking conservation of natural resources reducing energy consumption, and using
renewable energy are important starting points for our business activities. Important decisions
shall take due account of environmental consequences to create long‐term value for our
stakeholders, and the community at large. Environmental projects shall be executed within the
scope of our mission and shall be closely integrated into operational activities to cover in the
long term, the whole lifecycle of the products and services we supply. We want to maintain a
comprehensive view of environmental issues through a high level of competence among our
employees and by constantly developing our knowledge of the environmental consequences of
our actions. Environmental conservation measures shall be implemented to the extent they are
technically feasible, reasonable from a business economic point of view and environmentally
justified. Suppliers are encouraged to operate in line with our environmental policy. Suppliers
shall also be familiar with and observe requirements defined by national legislation, statutes,
and industry standards. Suppliers shall as a minimum requirement operate a secure system for
management of hazardous materials and waste together with a systematic approach aiming to
reduce the environmental footprint of their operations.
